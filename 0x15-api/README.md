# 0x15. API

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building Python scripts to interact with an API for organizing and exporting employee data into different data structures. It emphasizes the importance of using Python over Bash scripting for tasks like these, particularly when dealing with APIs.

## Background Context

Traditionally, system administrators relied heavily on Bash scripting for various tasks. While effective for many purposes, Bash scripts can become cumbersome and inefficient, especially when compared to other programming languages. Modern system administrators, often referred to as SREs (Site Reliability Engineers), possess a broader skill set, including proficiency in languages beyond Bash.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as a means to expose applications and datasets, allowing external parties to interact with them, access, and modify data. This project exemplifies a task ill-suited for Bash scripting, thus advocating for Python scripts.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, participants should be able to articulate the following concepts without external assistance:

- The limitations of Bash scripting
- Understanding of APIs and their functionality
- Familiarity with REST APIs and microservices
- Knowledge of CSV and JSON formats
- Adherence to Pythonic naming conventions and style guidelines

## Resources

- [Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script](link)
- [What is an API? In English, please](link)
- [What is a REST API](link)
- [What are microservices](link)
- [PEP8 Python style](link)

## Requirements

- Supported editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Libraries must be imported alphabetically
- Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code should adhere to PEP8 style
- All files must be executable
- Documentation for all modules
- Usage of `get` for accessing dictionary values by key
- Code should not execute when imported

## Copyright - Plagiarism

Participants are expected to devise solutions independently to meet the learning objectives outlined above. Plagiarism in any form is strictly prohibited and may result in expulsion from the program.
