# 0x09. Web Infrastructure Design Project
# Overview
This project focuses on web infrastructure design, emphasizing DevOps and SysAdmin concepts. Led by Sylvain Kalache, co-founder at Holberton School, the project is to be completed in teams of 3 people. Your team members are Gilbert Adikankwu, Bamidele Ipadeola, and Joe Egboka. The project runs from Dec 21, 2023, 6:00 AM, to Jan 2, 2024, 6:00 AM, with a mandatory manual QA review upon completion.

# Learning Objectives
Upon completion of the project, you are expected to:

- Draw a diagram of the web stack built in previous SysAdmin/DevOps projects.
- Explain the functionality of each component.
- Elaborate on system redundancy.
- Understand key acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS.

# Requirements
### General
- A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- Whiteboard or diagram for each task.
- Manual review for each task completion.

# Quiz Questions
- Answer quiz questions to demonstrate understanding.

# Tasks
1. Simple Web Stack
- Design a one-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com.
- Components: 1 server, 1 Nginx web server, 1 application server, 1 application codebase, 1 MySQL database.
- Configure domain name foobar.com with a www record pointing to server IP 8.8.8.8.
- Explain the role of each component and address issues (SPOF, downtime during maintenance, scalability limitations).

# Submission Guidelines
- Include a screenshot link for each completed task.
- Upload the answer file to GitHub and insert the GitHub file link into the URL box.

# Whiteboarding Sessions
- Each task requires a whiteboarding session in front of a mentor, staff, or student, without using computers or notes.

# Focus and Details
- Follow requirements meticulously; explore details in later projects.
- Be concise in explanations; avoid unnecessary details.
