# API Advanced Project

This project focuses on utilizing the Reddit API to practice API interactions, parsing JSON data, pagination, and more. It's designed to help you become proficient in working with APIs, which is valuable for technical interviews and real-world applications.

## Background Context

API-related questions are common in interviews, ranging from simple tasks like querying an endpoint to more complex challenges involving recursion and data manipulation. The Reddit API provides an excellent platform for practice due to its diverse endpoints and abundant data. Mastering API usage can not only enhance your technical skills but also streamline various tasks in your personal or professional projects.

## Resources

Before diving into the project, familiarize yourself with the following resources:

- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
- Query String
- Pagination

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Navigate API documentation to identify relevant endpoints
- Understand and implement pagination in API requests
- Parse JSON responses from APIs
- Execute recursive API calls when necessary
- Sort dictionaries by value

## Copyright - Plagiarism

To ensure learning integrity:

- Develop solutions independently to meet the learning objectives
- Avoid copying and pasting code from external sources
- Refrain from publishing any project content
- Strictly adhere to anti-plagiarism policies

## Requirements

Ensure your project meets the following criteria:

- Use vi, vim, or emacs as editors
- Code is interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- End all files with a newline character
- Start each file with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Organize imported libraries alphabetically
- Include a README.md file at the project's root directory
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Make all files executable
- Test file length using `wc`
- Document modules using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- Utilize the Requests module for HTTP requests to the Reddit API
