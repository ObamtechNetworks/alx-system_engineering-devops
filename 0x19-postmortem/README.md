# Postmortem README

## Project Overview

This project revolves around creating a postmortem document for analyzing and learning from system outages or failures. The purpose of this document is to provide insights into the causes of the outage, its impact, and measures taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. 

### Project Details

- **Start Date:** April 8, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** April 15, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Weight:** 1
- **Review:** Manual QA review required

## Background Context

In the world of software engineering, system failures are inevitable. These failures can result from various factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security vulnerabilities, hardware malfunctions, natural disasters, or human errors. However, failure presents an opportunity for learning and improvement. It is crucial for software engineers to analyze their mistakes, understand the root causes, and implement preventive measures to avoid recurrence.

A postmortem, also known as an incident report, is a common practice in the tech industry following system outages. It serves two primary purposes:

1. **Information Accessibility:** Providing comprehensive details about the outage ensures that all stakeholders within the company, including managers and executives, understand the incident's causes and potential impacts on operations.
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Conducting a thorough investigation helps identify the underlying reasons for the outage, enabling teams to implement corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Resources

To gain a deeper understanding of the postmortem process and its significance, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

## More Info

### Manual QA Review

As part of the project requirements, a manual QA review must be conducted before the deadline. This review ensures the quality and accuracy of the postmortem document. If peers are unavailable for review, TA or staff members can be approached for assistance.

## Conclusion

The postmortem process plays a crucial role in fostering a culture of accountability, learning, and continuous improvement within software development teams. By conducting thorough analyses of system failures and implementing preventive measures, organizations can enhance their resilience and reliability in delivering high-quality software solutions.
