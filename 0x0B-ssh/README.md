# Project 0x0B. - SSH
### Introduction
Welcome to Project 0x0B. SSH! In this project, we will explore various aspects of SSH (Secure Shell), focusing on understanding servers, SSH configuration, and the use of RSA keys for secure connections.

# Project Overview
### Background Context
In this project, you are assigned an Ubuntu server located in a distant datacenter. The primary method of connecting to this server is through SSH, utilizing an RSA key instead of a password. The server is pre-configured with the public key created in a previous project, and you can find the necessary connection details in the "my servers" section of the intranet.

# Resources
To successfully complete this project, it is recommended to go through the following resources:

- What is a (physical) server - text
- What is a (physical) server - video
- SSH essentials
- SSH Config File
- Public Key Authentication for SSH
- How Secure Shell Works
- SSH Crash Course (Highly informative video, consider watching at x1.25 speed or above)
- Understanding the SSH Encryption and Connection Process
- Secure Shell Wiki
- IETF RFC 4251 (Description of the SSH Protocol)
- Internet Engineering Task Force - Request for Comments

# Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

1. What is a server?
2. Where do servers usually live?
3. What is SSH?
4. How to create an SSH RSA key pair?
5. How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair?
6. The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash.

# Requirements
Ensure compliance with the following requirements:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpret all files on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be #!/usr/bin/env bash
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose.

# Conclusion
This project aims to enhance your understanding of servers, SSH, and secure connections. Feel free to explore additional resources and options related to the provided topics to deepen your knowledge. Good luck, and enjoy the journey into the world of SSH and system administration!
